This repository contains a comprehensive collection of projects focused on backend development and integration.

The work begins with foundational ES6 concepts, where I familiarized myself with modern JavaScript syntax, asynchronous operations, and the use of promises. Node.js was central to this trimesterâ€™s work, where I developed API integrations and managed requests through well-defined routes and request handlers.

Authentication and security were key focuses as well. I implemented basic and session-based authentication and built user authentication systems, learning to validate users securely. Data storage was another emphasis. I completed projects on both SQL and NoSQL databases where I explored data management techniques such as pagination and caching.

Finally, I honed my testing practices, working extensively on unit and integration tests in JavaScript.

This was all part of my education at Atlas School in Tulsa, Oklahoma. This repository is the culmination of my fourth trimester of work as I continue my transition from the world of education into the world of software engineering.
